      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Manpreet Singh, but most people call me Manny. I love creating applications for users. I've grown fond of using React and Front-end development. Currently, I'm delving into Back-end development in my free time. My love of programming started back in high school where I wanted to create a simple pop-up that you could never close, all for a prank. That was the gateway into creating more complex programs and learning about Computer Science. Fast forward to today, I am currently working as a Software Engingeer at Genista Biosciences working on both mobile and web apps.",
